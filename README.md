# Shinyvision.nvim

Hi! Welcome. This is the repository for my own Neovim configuration.

I do a lot in PHP and Go, so it is mainly optimized for that. There are some hard-coded paths, for example to `/home/rachel/go-projects/vimfony/vimfony` and `~/.config/ludtwig/ludtwig-config.toml`. These are for myself. If you use [Vimfony](https://github.com/shinyvision/vimfony), you can easily replace that with just `vimfony`, so it takes the binary from your PATH.

I started this config from [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and added my own nicities from there. init.lua is a bit of a mess, but it works.
